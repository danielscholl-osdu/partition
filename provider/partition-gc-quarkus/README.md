# Partition Service

**partition-gc-quarkus** is a [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) service that is responsible retrieving partition specific
properties on behalf of other services whether they are secret values or not.

## Features

*
Implements [Partition API](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/platform/system/partition/-/blob/master/docs/api/partition_openapi.yaml?ref_type=heads)
* Reads partition configurations from a directory specified by the `PARTITION_CONFIGS_PATH` environment variable
  (configs are stored as json files in this directory).
* Automatically reloads the configuration when files in the directory are created, modified, or deleted.
* Utilizes a "debounce" delay (set via the DIRECTORY_WATCH_DEBOUNCE_DELAY_MS environment variable) to prevent redundant
  reloads when multiple changes occur in a short timeframe.
* **Note:** This service has no authentication, so it must not be exposed directly to the public or untrusted networks.

## Limitations

* No authentication or authorization — ensure the service is protected at network or platform level.

## Building and Running

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing
purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* Maven 3.8.0+
* JDK 17
* Docker (for native image and containerization)
* Linux or macOS (for GraalVM native image; see Quarkus native build guide)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. **Navigate to the Quarkus Provider Module:**

```bash
cd provider/partition-gc-quarkus/
```

3. **Build the Native Executable:**
   To build a native (GraalVM) executable:

```bash
mvn clean package -Dnative
```

The resulting binary will be located at target/partition-gc-quarkus-*-runner.

4. **Build the Docker Image (Native):**

First, ensure you have GraalVM installed and configured correctly. Then, build the native image:

```bash
mvn package -Pnative
```

```bash
docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.native -t quarkus/partition .
```

5. **Run the Service (Docker, Native Mode):**

Assuming your partition config files are under /path_to_partitions:

```bash
docker run -i --rm \
 -p 8080:8080 \
 -v /path_to_partitions:/data \
 quarkus/partition \
 -DPARTITION_CONFIGS_PATH=/data
```

## Running Locally (JVM Mode)

For development and testing, you may run the service from your IDE or the command line:

```bash
cd provider/partition-gc-quarkus/
mvn quarkus:dev
```

Or to run the packaged jar:

```bash
cd provider/partition-gc-quarkus/
mvn clean package
java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar \
-DPARTITION_CONFIGS_PATH=/path_to_partitions
```

Define the following environment variables.

Must have:

| name                     | value         | description                                                    | sensitive? | source |
|--------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------|
| `PARTITION_CONFIGS_PATH` | ex `/configs` | Path to the directory containing partition configuration files | false      | -      |

Defined in default application property file but possible to override:

| name                                | value     | description                                                        | sensitive? | source |
|-------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------|
| `DIRECTORY_WATCH_DEBOUNCE_DELAY_MS` | ex `300`  | Debounce interval between directory changes and config (re)loading | no         | -      |
| `MANAGEMENT_ENDPOINTS_WEB_BASE`     | ex `/`    | Web base for Actuator                                              | no         | -      |
| `MANAGEMENT_SERVER_PORT`            | ex `8081` | Port for Actuator                                                  | no         | -      |

### Running E2E Tests

Use [partition-acceptance-test](../../partition-acceptance-test)

```bash
# build + install acceptance tests
$ (cd partition-acceptance-test/ && mvn clean install)
```
