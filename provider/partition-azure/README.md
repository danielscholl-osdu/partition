# Running Locally - Azure
## Requirements

In order to run this service locally, you will need the following:
- JDK 17
- [Maven 3.8.0+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- Lombok 1.18 or later

## General Tips

**Environment Variable Management**
The following tools make environment variable configuration simpler
 - [direnv](https://direnv.net/) - for a shell/terminal environment
 - [EnvFile](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7861-envfile) - for [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

**Lombok**
This project uses [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) for code generation. You may need to configure your IDE to take advantage of this tool.
 - [Intellij configuration](https://projectlombok.org/setup/intellij)
 - [VSCode configuration](https://projectlombok.org/setup/vscode)
 
### Environment Variables

In order to run the service locally, you will need to have the following environment variables defined.

**Note** The following command can be useful to pull secrets from keyvault:
```bash
az keyvault secret show --vault-name $KEY_VAULT_NAME --name $KEY_VAULT_SECRET_NAME --query value -otsv
```

### Configure Maven

Check that maven is installed:
```bash
$ mvn --version
Apache Maven 3.8.0
Maven home: /usr/share/maven
Java version: 17.0.7
...
```


### Build and run the application

After configuring your environment as specified above, you can follow these steps to build and run the application. These steps should be invoked from the *repository root.*

```bash
# build + test + install core service code
$ mvn clean install

# build + test + package azure service code
$ (cd provider/partition-azure/ && mvn clean package)

# run service
#
# Note: this assumes that the environment variables for running the service as outlined
#       above are already exported in your environment.
$ java -jar $(find provider/partition-azure/target/ -name '*-spring-boot.jar')
```


### Test the application

After the service has started it should be accessible via a web browser by visiting [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html). If the request does not fail, you can then run the integration tests.

```bash
# build + install integration test core
$ (cd testing/partition-test-core/ && mvn clean install)

# build + run Azure integration tests.
#
# Note: this assumes that the environment variables for integration tests as outlined
#       above are already exported in your environment.
$ (cd testing/partition-test-azure/ && mvn clean test)
```

A liveness check can also be performed at `http://localhost:8080/api/partition/v1/actuator/health`. Other apis can be found on the swagger page
