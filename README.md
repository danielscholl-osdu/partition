# Introduction

The Partition service is responsible for creating and retrieving partition specific properties on behalf of other services whether they are secret values or not. It is a Maven multi-module project with each cloud implementation placed in its submodule.

## Community Implementation
It is containing an Open-Source version with os-osm Driver containing the postgres db for consumption. As of now the code is not having any authentication for core-plus as it is not having the infra for authentication.
So, currently it's only enough to run and consume the service locally, for development and understanding purpose.

One could either spin up a postgres docker container locally, and use along with local partition service code. Or else, fetch the container image for postgres service and Partition service both and then use them. More details [here](./README.md#running-locally---partition-core-plus)
