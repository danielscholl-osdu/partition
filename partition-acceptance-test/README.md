### Running E2E Tests

You will need to have the following environment variables defined.

| name                 | value                      | description                | sensitive? | source | required |
|----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|------------|--------|----------|
| `MY_TENANT`          | ex `osdu`                  | Self Tenant name           | no         | -      | yes      |
| `PARTITION_BASE_URL` | ex `http://localhost:8080` | Partition service Base URL | no         | -      | yes      |

Authentication can be provided as OIDC config:

| name                                            | value                                      | description                   | sensitive? | source |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|--------|
| `PRIVILEGED_USER_OPENID_PROVIDER_CLIENT_ID`     | `********`                                 | Privileged User Client Id     | yes        | -      |
| `PRIVILEGED_USER_OPENID_PROVIDER_CLIENT_SECRET` | `********`                                 | Privileged User Client secret | yes        | -      |
| `TEST_OPENID_PROVIDER_URL`                      | ex `https://keycloak.com/auth/realms/osdu` | OpenID provider url           | yes        | -      |

Or tokens can be used directly from env variables:

| name                    | value      | description           | sensitive? | source |
|-------------------------|------------|-----------------------|------------|--------|
| `PRIVILEGED_USER_TOKEN` | `********` | Privileged User Token | yes        | -      |

Authentication configuration is optional and could be omitted if not needed.

Execute following command to build code and run all the integration tests:

 ```bash
 # Note: this assumes that the environment variables for integration tests as outlined
 #       above are already exported in your environment.
 # build + install integration test core
 $ (cd partition-acceptance-test && mvn clean test)
 ```
